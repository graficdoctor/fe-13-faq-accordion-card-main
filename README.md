## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first

### What I learned

I started this excercise several months ago and somehow never could finish it, due to lack of time. Back then I also hadn't learned about positioning yet and had no idea how to accomplish the positioning of the images.
At first I had used `<button>` to activate the Questions in the accordeon. In the meantime I did came across many articles discussing 'When to use the button-tag'. In order to keep it semantically correct. Too bad I didn't keep track of the solutions in GitHub yet.

### Useful resources

- [How to build an Accordion Menu using HTML, CSS and JavaScript](https://dev.to/ubahthebuilder/how-to-build-an-accordion-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript-3omb) - This helped me figure out how to the accordeon with JavaScript.
